    <p>
A work is finished when we can no longer improve it, though we know it to be inadequate and incomplete. 
We are so overtaxed by it that we no longer have the power to add a single comma, however indispensable. 
What determines the degree to which a work is finished is not a requirement of art or of truth, it is exhaustion and, even, disgust.
